# Online Transpot Management Platform

## Installation

We need docker and docker compose installed. So let's install them first.

```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install docker.io

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

```
